# RestAPIs_MVC_Architecture
- This is a basic Spring Boot Project.
- In this project I have made 2 APIs that are GET and POST.
- I have made a simple User model class which consist of User's name , id , country and age.
- GET API is used to get all the users of the database.
- POST API is used to create and add a new user in the database.
